<p><strong>Under</strong> the warm light of the lamps, House Maid Emily was bending over the writing desk, slightly trembling with nervousness. Her eyes were in darkness, because of the leather blindfold.</p>
<p>  ​​Sir Andrew Russel, heir to The Crane Whistling Manor, poured himself another glass of sherry, took a sip, and then paced to Emily. The poor girl dropped and broke a plate accidentally when she was serving food, leaving a fine set of tableware incomplete, which would never be tolerated by her master, a perfectionist. Under normal conditions, Emily would be punished severely, but The Lord of the Manor was a good man. He decided to give her something different.</p>
<p>  ​​&quot;Shall we play a game, Emily?&quot; Andrew put down his glass and picked up a leather paddle from a whole row of toys on the couch.</p>
<p>  ​​&quot;Yes, my Lord.&quot; Emily trembled as if she did not feel the kindness of her master.</p>
<p>  ​​&quot;Good. Now, let&rsquo;s see the rule.&quot; Andrew lapped the leather paddle in his another hand, &ldquo;The toy in my hand will touch your arse one time, then you should guess what it is. If the answer is right, you will be lashed by ten with this toy. Or, if the answer is incorrect, the toy will touch your arse one more time, and you should guess again. If the answer is correct this time, you will be lashed by twenty with this toy. Or if incorrect again unfortunately, the guess continues. Of course, there is an upper limit, fifty. Do you understand it?&rdquo;</p>
<p>  ​​&quot;Yes, Sir.&quot; Emily was a clever girl. She fully understood the rule and was even more scared.</p>
<p>  ​​&quot;Very good.&quot; Andrew put the leather paddle back, and picked up a three tail tawse, &ldquo;Take off your knickers and let&rsquo;s do it, Emily.”</p>
<p>  ​​&quot;Yes, Sir.&rdquo; Emily was obedient and quick to take off her knickers, though she felt a tinge of shame.</p>
<p>  ​​&quot;Guess what it is, Emily.&quot; The tawse touched Emily at its side edge.</p>
<p>  ​​&quot;It is a paddle, Sir.&quot; She dare not keep her master waiting too long, and she thought she heard the lapping.</p>
<p>  ​​&quot;You are a clever girl, Emily. But you guessed wrong unfortunately.&quot; Andrew put the tawse back on Emily&rsquo;s arse and said, &ldquo;Guess again.&rdquo;</p>
<p>  ​​Emily followed her intuition from experience and thought it was a tawse. However, she hesitated, because she knew there were two different tawses, the two tail one and the three tail one, and she was not sure which one it was.</p>
<p>  ​​&quot;Emily?&quot; Her master was losing his patience.</p>
<p>  ​​&quot;It is the three tail tawse, my Lord.&quot; Emily answered immediately, as she remembered Sir Andrew preferred that one.</p>
<p>  ​​&quot;Well done, Emily, well done.&quot; Andrew was a little excited.</p>
<p>  ​​But Emily knew the doom was felling upon her and felt a burning pain in her arse very soon with a sharp whipping. She just jerked her head up and gasped but dared not make a sound. &ldquo;Keep your position and no wails.&rdquo; was remembered by Emily as the basic rules of the Crane Whistling Manor.</p>
<p>  ​​After twenty whippings, Sir Andrew dropped the tawse back, picked up his sherry, and tossed off. Then he admired his work, holding the empty glass, and heard Emily&rsquo;s sob, feeling quite carefree. After that, Sir Andrew paced to the couch and chose a black lexan cane from the toys.</p>
<p>  When Teresa Green was allowed into the library, she realized how serious the matter was immediately. Sir Andrew just left three bright red marks on Emily&rsquo;s arse, while the deliberately suppressed wail of pain from Emily made her feel more nervous and stressed. As the Head House Parlor Maid, Teresa knew she was partly to blame for Emily&rsquo;s mistake. She came for forgiveness on her own initiative, hoping to make a good impression on her Lord. By the way, it was heard that the butler had nominated her for under housekeeper, which meant she was going to be called Mrs Green.</p>
<p>  Obviously, the future Mrs. Green had already regretted her indiscretion. Sir Andrew knew well why she had come, did not even glance at her, and still punished the girl bending over the writing desk methodically. Without the further instructions from Sir Andrew, Teresa could only stand by, watch the other poor girl being flogged, and be tortured by the tense atmosphere and empathetic pain.</p>
<p>  Emily guessed right with great luck at the first time in this round. However, she had not expected anyone else to enter the room, which made her even more ashamed. The face that had just buried a little deeper lifted up again reflexively, when the pain came as expected. Emily&rsquo;s palms were sweaty, leaving two hand-prints on the desk. Tears trickled down her cheeks. Even her arse was sweaty, glistening under the light, making the red marks stinging and urticant. She felt being cauterized by the scourge of hell. Emily longed for a breath of relief, while she was always quickly overwhelmed by the waves of pain.</p>
<p>  After ten red marks were evenly printed on Emily&rsquo;s arse, the poor girl got a temporary relief. Then Sir Andrew turned to Teresa, making her even more perturbed. He took a sip of sherry and talked to Teresa.</p>
<p>  “Good evening, Mrs. Green. You are a very responsible woman. Do you want to join the game?”</p>
<p>  “Oh, yes, my Lord. Thank you, my Lord.” For a short moment, Teresa, or Mrs. Green didn&rsquo;t know whether to be happy or afraid.</p>
<p>  “Take off your knickers, and bend over the desk next to Emily.” Sir Andrew handed her a leather blindfold.</p>
<p>  “Yes, my Lord.” Mrs. Green acted dexterously under Sir Andrew&rsquo;s instruction, and even slightly upwarped her arse to satisfy her Lord.</p>
<p>  “Since here we have two girls now, it is necessary to amend the rules, shall we?” Sir Andrew put down his wine and said.</p>
<p>  “Yes, my Lord.” The two girls answered together with some trill.</p>
<p>  Subsequently, Sir Andrew announced the new rules.</p>
<p>  “Mrs. Green, your arse will be touched by the toy in my hand, and you should guess what it is like Emily just did. If the answer is incorrect, you will be lashed by ten with the toy, while if the answer is correct, Emily will be lashed by ten with the toy, and vice versa. You will guess the toys in rotation. Am I understood?”</p>
<p>  “Yes, my Lord.” Answered by Teresa.</p>
<p>  “Emily?”</p>
<p>  “Yes, Sir, please.” Emily could not help crying.</p>
<p>  “All right, Mrs. Green first.” Sir Andrew picked up an oak paddle, made of hard and heavy wood, and poke Teresa gently in her arse.</p>
<p>  “It&rsquo;s a paddle, my Lord. A oak paddle I think.” Teresa answered tentatively.</p>
<p>  “What a pathetic girl!” Sir Andrew sighed, making Teresa&rsquo;s heart almost jump into her mouth. After a pause, Sir Andrew named the pathetic girl, “Emily.”</p>
<p>  When the paddle lashed Emily&rsquo;s arse at the first time, she threw the basic rules of the Crane Whistling Manor out then window. A shrill wail rang out in the room suddenly. Teresa&rsquo;s heart was pounding in this occasion. Soon she heard another crash of a paddle against the flesh, and a louder wail. She could even hear Emily stamping her feet on the floor. Emily clutched at the edge of the desk, fighting the pain with all her might on the verge of collapse. She dreaded the next lashing, but longed for the torment to be over as soon as possible. Fortunately, ten was not much.</p>
<p>  Sir Andrew was pleased with his work, looking at Emily&rsquo;s red arse. He replaced the oak paddle with a rattan cane for the next round. Though Emily could barely feel the cane on her arse because it hurt too much, she guessed right after all. Unlike Emily, when the cane lashed Teresa hard on her arse, she could not help holding her upper body like a dolphin out of the water, lifting one leg, and tightening her arse against the burning pain. She remained in this position and gasped for a while.</p>
<p>  “Position, Mrs. Green. Be elegant, will you?” Sir Andrew tapped Teresa’s waist and leg with the cane.</p>
<p>  “Yes, Sir.” Teresa went back to the right position immediately, and straightened her legs. But obviously, she was trembling.</p>
<p>  Sir Andrew was quite satisfied and swung the rattan cane dexterously again and again, leaving ten bright red marks on the snow white arse evenly, and one more crying girl bending over the desk.</p>
<p>  When the butler Mr. Carson walked into the room, he saw Sir Andrew was leaning in the couch, holding his sherry, and watching two girls with bare red arse standing side by side facing the bookshelf. He had come to confirm the Lord’s schedule for the next day, and had unwittingly freed the two poor girls. Sir Andrew left the library with the butler, leaving girls crying on each other’s shoulder. They had to maintain and store those toys which scared them awfully, before leaving the room.​​​​</p>
